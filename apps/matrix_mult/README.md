# VADD Example

This example is a minimalistic example of how to construct a hardware-accelerated web application utilizing this repository. It can be used a starting template by copying the entire directory into a new parallel one and searching and replacing 'vadd' with the desired kernel name. TODO: A script could be provided to do this.

The hardware kernel performs an identical function to the Xilinx example kernel created from their RTL Kernel Wizard. It simply adds one to vectors of integer values.
