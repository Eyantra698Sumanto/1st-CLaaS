# Mandelbrot Explorer

## Demo

The Mandelbrot example is hosted [here](http://fractalvalley.net), by [Steve Hoover](mailto:stevehoover@redwoodeda.com), without hardware acceleration.
It includes an About page with general project information.

## Development

### Integration

There is no continuous integration testing. Just open it locally and check it out before making a pull request.

### Deployment

Steve holds the button to redeploy your changes. If he forgets, please [let him know](mailto:stevehoover@redwoodeda.com).

### TO DO

General TO DO items are kept here, where as the issue tracker is used for more specific items. Contact [Steve](mailto:stevehoover@redwoodeda.com) for more details if you are interested in working on any of these items.

#### Web Design

The web page is quick-n-dirty. It could use a designer's touch.

#### Web Dev

There are currently two views, map (using Open Layers) and full-image. Open Layers is great, but it assumes a static image.
It doesn't work for 3-D. And it doesn't refresh when parameters are changed. There is plenty of opportunity to build the
best of both.

#### Building Momentum

Get the word out there and build interest. Put together some flashy demos, fly-through videos.

#### 3-D

Play w/ 3-D controls. Create videos. Get this working in VR displays (like Dodo Case).

#### Algorithms

The current algorithms are brute-force ones. There are ways to optimize. [Some ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K0gPk9uK7av3IdA827IM3OaHT1pDNHdVi7VGKfMQwHc/edit?usp=sharing).

#### FPGA Optimizations

The current FPGA implementation is not optimized and utilizes a fraction of the available FPGA resources. It could be sped up substantially with a little effort. [Some ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K0gPk9uK7av3IdA827IM3OaHT1pDNHdVi7VGKfMQwHc/edit?usp=sharing).
