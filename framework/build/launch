# This script can be used by the application to start the host application built for sw or hw.
# It MUST be invoked from the application's build directory and should generally be invoked via 'make TARGET=xx launch'.
#
# TODO: This is a big hack. The webserver should open the socket and start the host and tear down
#       the socket and host when it's done/killed. (Though consider how gdb can be run within editor where the editor must execute the host command.)

# Usage:
#   ./launch [-c <compile-command>] [-o <opencl-host-app-args>] [-w <webserver-command>] <hw/sw> [<host-command>]
# Usage Cases (without optional args):
#   ./launch hw '<path/to/host> <path/to/awsxclbin>'
#   ./launch hw_emu '<path/to/host> <path/to/xclbin>'
#   ./launch sw   # <host-command> defaults to "../out/$TARGET/host" for sw target.
# Debug Usage Cases (without optional args):
#   ../out/sw/host &  # from within debugger
#   ps aux | grep ../out/sw/host
#   launch -h <pid> sw '<host-command>'   # OR
#   launch -h none sw '<host-command>'    # to not kill host on exit ("none" is anything that isn't a whole number)
# Optional args:
#   -p <port>: The port number on which to launch. 8888 by default.
#   -c <compile-command>: The compile command used to rebuilt when upgraded.
#   -w <python-webserver-command>: The command to launch the webserver. '<<PORT>>' will be substituted with the port number.

# Must be launched from the projects 'build' directory because:
#   o If -w is not specified or the project utilizes default routing, the default web content paths are "../webserver/*".

# TODO: Make a function to wrap commands in sudo.
